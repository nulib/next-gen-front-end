# Next generation presentation layer hi-res mockups
Sketch-pad HTML layouts for Northwestern Library's Next Generation presentation layer.  The idea is to use this repository as a place to experiment with different types of page layouts, without at live data attached. Just markup.

### How to use
To view latest `/master` branch go to: https://nulib.github.io/next-gen-front-end/

To develop, start a local server and load `index.html` in any browser.  For example, to use lightweight `http-server`, do:

`npm install http-server`, or if you prefer yarn `yarn add http-server` in your local project directory.  Then execute `http-server` in same directory and it will load the site with JavaScript dependencies.

### Dependencies
All layouts are created from assets in Northwestern's global marketing templates:
https://github.com/nuwebcomm/templates

There are some dependencies from these templates, but they're all hardcoded into the HTML pages in this repo.

This repository will be live development of the Next Generation presentation layer, connected to our Hyrax application (Donut).  Currently using ReactJS/Redux for framework, handling all data flow and routing on the client-side.
